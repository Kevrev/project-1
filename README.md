This project was to work together in a group of 3-5 and make an application using the various skills that we have learned so far in class. One of our requirements is that we are to have at least two server side API's and not use bootstrap. As a group we decided to do an application that would give local ski resorts in the United States after the user puts in their location into the search bar to use a location based API. The goal of the application would be to produce the closest three resorts on cards underneath a map displaying the location of the resort. Also at the bottom of the page a weather display API will be displayed showing at least a 5 day forecast for the resort.
